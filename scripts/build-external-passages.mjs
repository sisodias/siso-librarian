// Make the Internet Archive books searchable, without touching gid semantics.
//
// WHY THIS IS SAFE WHERE A gid INSERT WAS NOT. On 2026-08-04 I refused to add
// these books to the `passage` table because `gid INTEGER` is documented as the
// Gutenberg Text# and 1,184,937 rows join on it. That objection is about a JOIN
// KEY. It does not apply to search: `passage_search` declares
//
//     CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE passage_search USING fts5(gid UNINDEXED, ...)
//
// UNINDEXED means FTS5 stores the column as an opaque passthrough — it is never
// compared, joined or ordered on. A TEXT identifier works exactly as well.
//
// So this builds a SEPARATE index, mirroring the live schema with `ext_id TEXT`
// where `gid INTEGER` sits. Separate file, so a bug here cannot disturb the
// 41.5M-row live index; identical column shape, so the two can be queried the
// same way and merged later if that ever becomes the right call.
//
// PARAGRAPH SEGMENTATION. DjVuTXT is OCR of scanned pages: hard-wrapped lines,
// running headers, page numbers. Splitting on blank lines yields thousands of
// one-line fragments. This joins wrapped lines within a paragraph and drops
// segments that are mostly non-alphabetic — scan artefacts, not prose.
//
//   build-external-passages.mjs           build the index
//   build-external-passages.mjs --check   report what is indexed
