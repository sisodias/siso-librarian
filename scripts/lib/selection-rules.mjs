//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured 2026-08-06: build-want-list.mjs gained two rules in
// one day — an age-based rights upgrade and an archival-correspondence filter —
// and NEITHER could be tested. Both lived inside a script that fetches from the
// Internet Archive at import time, so there was no way to assert their behaviour
// without a network round-trip.
//
// These are the highest-consequence rules in the repo: one decides the RIGHTS
// BASIS on which a book is admitted, the other decides whether an item is a book
// at all. "Cannot be pointed at a fixture" is the defect class that has cost the
// most here, and it had reached the rights layer.
//
// PRECEDENT: lib/vault-paths.mjs after eight hardcoded paths, lib/claim-paths.mjs
// after five claim mis-keys, lib/snapshot-paths.mjs after four snapshot mis-keys.
// Same mechanism, fourth application.

// A work published before 1929 is public domain in the US whatever an uploader
// typed in the rights field.

// public domain, with no formal designation behind it". It never promotes
// 'none' (metadata says nothing) or 'not-a-designation' (metadata says something
// that is not a rights grant), because age cannot substitute for evidence that
// was never offered.
//
// Deliberately conservative on missing data: no year means no upgrade.
//
// Measured on the ninth want-list: 538 of 1,076 bare-assertion items were
// pre-1929, ranging 1611-1928. On the eighth list only 15 of 2,761 were — so

// usable OCR layer.

// want-list, ZERO have a title beginning "Letters from/to" — every one is the
// archival form, "<Name> Letter to <person> <date>".
