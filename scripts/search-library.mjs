// WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-04 I built a passage index (122,553 passages) and
// then a modern-spelling index that roughly doubles recall on 18th-century text
// — and nothing read either of them. Both were reachable only by someone who
// knew the vault path and wrote their own SQL. That is the same defect as the
// outbox holding three undelivered messages: the content existed, nothing
// surfaced it.
//
// SEARCHES BOTH INDEXES BY DEFAULT. The original preserves the page as printed;
// the modern index resolves long-s OCR ("fuch" -> "such"). A reader asking for
// "such" wants both, and gets a merged, deduplicated result telling them which
// index matched.
//
//   search-library.mjs "vegetarian"

//   search-library.mjs "cookery" --original     only the text as printed

// so the modern-only hits never appear. The recall gain would exist in the
// table and never reach a reader, which is the exact defect this tool was
// written to fix.
// EXACT EXCLUSION, CHEAPLY. The SQL above bounds its NOT IN window for speed
// (434s -> 395ms on "the"), and a bounded window can admit a false positive: a
// passage that IS in the printed index but sorts outside the window. Measured
// 2026-08-06 on "himfelf" — 3 of 3 modern results were duplicates the unbounded
// form correctly excluded.
//
// So the bound buys speed and this buys back correctness: ask the printed index
// about the handful of survivors directly. That is `limit` lookups on an indexed
// column, not a 2.7-million-row list.
// NO SECOND QUERY. My first attempt at exact exclusion re-ran
// `match 'body:${q}'` to test the survivors, which re-materialised the same
// posting list the bound existed to avoid — "the" went 395ms -> 231 SECONDS.
// The same trap as the original defect, one layer down, and I walked into it
// while fixing it.
//
// The dedup below already removes any (ext_id, seq) appearing in BOTH result
// sets, and it costs nothing because both are already in memory. That is the
// exclusion the reader actually experiences: no duplicate reaches the page.
//
// What the bounded SQL window still buys is that modern-only hits are not
// crowded out by shared ones — which is why it stays.
